# How to create an effective GitHub profile:

Recruiters or **technical interviewers** usually review the CV + the **GitHub profile**, so having a good profile can give you many advantages when it comes to being considered for a job.

## üí° Tips that can help you:

### Fill out the basic data
- Professional and contact information
- Photo

### Create profile repository
- Steps: Add repo with name `<username>` and check off the option to add README.md üëâ [see documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
- Add to the README.md links to the most important projects (and pin them)
- Give it personality (the README.md description doesn't have to be like a formal resume)
- Examples:
    - [https://github.com/ymulenll](https://github.com/ymulenll)
    - [https://github.com/thmsgbrt](https://github.com/thmsgbrt)
    - [https://github.com/gautamkrishnar](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar)
    - [https://github.com/anmol098](https://github.com/anmol098)
    - [https://github.com/Prince-Shivaram](https://github.com/Prince-Shivaram)
- You can start your README.md using [this webpage](https://rahuldkjain.github.io/gh-profile-readme-generator/)
- Learn the language used to write and modify `.md` files üëâ [see documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github)
- Important for SEO (it is what appears as a description in search engines)

### Upload **all** your projects:
- Shows the way you organize projects (file structure) and your coding style
- Clean code tips:
    - Readlable variable names
    - Small functions focused on one thing
    - Files with few lines of code and focused on few things (Avoid generic files where you add anything)
    - Avoid redundant comments (if you make clean code with small functions, you usually don't need many comments)
    
### Add metadata in projects:
- Description, website, tags

### Add README.md to **all** projects:
- It must include:
    - Purpose and use cases of your project
    - Installation instructions (if necessary)
    - Demo: screenshots, gifs and/or website (github pages, netlify)
- This shows:
    - The ability to communicate (super important)
    - Interest in working on a project for a long time (discipline, perseverance)
        
### Frequent *Commits*
<img width="400" alt="commits" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3630913/194914586-c74ed783-b581-41e2-a3a3-e6d1b29e8e9f.png">
    
- Activity in *commits*, showing consistency is an indicator of your level of interest and discipline
- Good practices when doing *commits*:
    - The *Commits* should be small and focused on a specific change or task
    - Comments in imperative
- Activate private contributions

### Star ‚≠êÔ∏è projects (add a star this repo if you wish üòÅ)
- This shows the technologies they are interested in
- Don't *fork* projects you don't work on

### Create website and host it with GitHub pages
- [Create main page](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Host any existing repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

### Pro Tip: Automate with Actions
- üëâ [see documentation](https://github.com/features/actions)
- example: [Update README with the latest Youtube videos](https://github.com/ymulenll/ymulenll/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-readme.yml)

### Contribute to *Open Source*
- They can start with small things like correcting errors in the documentation
